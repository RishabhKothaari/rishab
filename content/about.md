I am currently pusrsuing my Master's in Computer Science with focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Portland State University.
I have previously worked as a Software Engineer and built backend and frontend web software. At present I am learning about current trends in Deep Learning with Computer Vision to solve complex problems. I believe in constant growth through learning, contribution, and collaboration with problem solvers.
