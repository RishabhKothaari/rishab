### Problem

Perform the handwritten digit recognition task.This task involves classifying the MNIST digits into their respective classes(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 labelled images of handwritten digits and the task is to come up with a function that can classfify these digits into their respective classes.
