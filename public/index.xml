      <description>I am currently pusrsuing my Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science with focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Portland State University. I have previously worked as a Software Engineer and built backend and frontend web software. At present I am learning about current trends in Deep Learning with Computer Vision to solve complex problems. I believe in constant growth through learning, contribution, and collaboration with problem solvers.
In my free time, I like to travel, listening to uplifting EDM tunes, watching adrenaline rushing sports and reading books on Psychology.</description>
